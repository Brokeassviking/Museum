    <h2>Solar Eclipse</h2>
    <p>
      A solar eclipse occurs when a portion of the Earth is engulfed in a shadow
      cast by the Moon which fully or partially blocks sunlight. This occurs
      when the Sun, Moon and Earth are aligned. Such alignment coincides with a
      new moon (syzygy) indicating the Moon is closest to the ecliptic plane In
      a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon. In
      partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is obscured.
