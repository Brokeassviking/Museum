      <h1>Explore the wonders of our cosmos.</h1>
      <p>
        Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and
        what we can see and know about the universe around us. We’ll locate the
        various constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit
        about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by. Follow the
        journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to Galileo’s
        telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in our solar system.

        As of January 2018, people from 37 countries have traveled in space. 553
        people have reached Earth orbit. 556 have reached the altitude of space
        according to the FAI definition of the boundary of space, and 562 people
        have reached the altitude of space according to the American definition.
        24 people have traveled beyond low Earth orbit and either circled,
        orbited, or walked on the Moon.

      <h2>Solar Eclipse</h2>
      <p>
        A solar eclipse occurs when a portion of the Earth is engulfed in a
        shadow cast by the Moon which fully or partially blocks sunlight. This
        occurs when the Sun, Moon and Earth are aligned. Such alignment
        coincides with a new moon (syzygy) indicating the Moon is closest to the
        ecliptic plane In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured
        by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is
        obscured.

        Galileo’s thoughts went from wanting to see the stars to inventing the
        telescope
