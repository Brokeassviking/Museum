        Biology and Medicine From micro-organisms to the human body, major
        breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique insights into the great
        wonders of the tiny world. For many people their life expectancy is much
        longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of
        our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the
        history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs
        including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant.
        Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab,
        but also from observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures
        have beat us to it.

        <h2>Rod of Asclepius</h2>
        <p>
          In Greek mythology, the Rod of Asclepius (Greek: Ράβδος του Ασκληπιού,
          Rábdos tou Asklipioú, sometimes also spelled Asklepios), also known as
          the Staff of Aesculapius and as the asklepian is a serpent-entwined
          rod wielded by the Greek god Asclepius, a deity associated with
          healing and medicine. The symbol has continued to be used in modern
          times, where it is associated with medicine and health care, yet
          frequently confused with the staff of the god Hermes, the caduceus.
          Theories have been proposed about the Greek origin of the symbol and
          its implications.<br />
